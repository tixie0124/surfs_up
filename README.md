* We've discovered that the difference of temperature between June and December is smaller than previously expected. The mean of the temperature is almost 75 degree F, which is significantly higher than the 71 degree F average temperature in December. However, such a discrepancy is lower than typical. 
* The minimnum temperature in June(64 degree F) is significantly higher than the minimum temperature in December(56 degree F). 
* One interesting observation is that the quantity of temperautre collection in June is almost 200 more than the number of collection in December.

## Summary
Despite the fact that the average temperature in December does not deviate too much from the average temperature in June, the temperature in December does fluctuate more - the standard deviation(3.74) is significnatly higher than the standard deviation of the temperature in June(3.2). In the past, 50% of the days in June has a temperature that is higher than or  equal equal to 75 degree F. In Decembers, 50% or more days has a temperature higher than or equal to 71 degree F. However, as mentioned before, the differences are much smaller than what we previously expected. We need more information to make a conclusive judgement, such as precipitation and moisture, both of which are factors that will have an impact on the local weather.
